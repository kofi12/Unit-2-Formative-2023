### Unit 2 Formative Assignment

In this assignment you will explore the concept of functions and modules
by creating a program that performs various numerical operations using functions

## Task 1

- create the functions below in the file `operations.py`

## Task 2

- create a function called `check_even_odd` that takes a parameter `number`
- inside the function determine whether the number is even or odd
- the function should return the string "even" or "odd"

## Task 3

- create a function called `factorial` that takes a parameter `number`
- in the function calculate the factorial of the number, if you don't know factorial you can google or ask me. It is fairly simple
- the function should return the answer

## Task 4

- create a function called `convert_temperature` that takes two parameters `temperature` and `unit`
- inside the function convert the temperature from celsuis to fahrenheit if the unit is "C", or 
from fahrenheit to celsuis if the unit if "F".
- return the converted temperature


## Note

make sure all function names are the same as you see here, also make sure to return exactly what is specified.
Your code will be auto-graded using test cases
